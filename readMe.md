### Suggested update to openEO process specification to allow CWL scripts to be run within an openEO environment
The primary purpose of this project is to define a number of new openEO processes that will allow the execution of CWL scripts within an openEO environment. These definitions will be defined, as with the current processes, in JSON format, for implementation to be completed separately by an implementation developer. This implementation is not to be done under this project, although a number of test scripts may be included to provide examples of what these scripts might look like.

Note, all JSON files here based on those found in the git repo for [openeo-processes](https://github.com/eodcgmbh/openeo-processes/tree/7044771f54525f6b613a8fc065f5f7d688eeca35)
Note, any regex has been developed and testing using the web-app [here](https://regex101.com/r/wApQYM/1). Most of the regex pattern expressions here are just first attempts and need to be expanded to ensure accurate definitions.

### How to use this repository
Once you have the repo cloned, all code should be executed in a virtual environment running Python 3.9(.18). To create a virtual environment called `venv` run `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.9 venv`. To start the virtual environment run `source venv/bin.activate`. Then install the required packages by running `pip install -r reuqirements.txt`. Now you are free to start running any of the Python scripts as you please. Note that some scripts may need updating to use different file paths for your own local files, as well as updating any GitHub tokens, for example in the [cwl_preparation.py](https://github.com/tjellicoe-tpzuk/openeo_processes_update/blob/main/cwl_preparation.py) script you must add your own GitHub token to upload the selected file to your own GitHub repo.
